This is a quick apology for the recent server outage on zSnout. Our servers
normally restart every two hours, and this is a purposeful thing. You'll even
see a "Connecting to zServer..." message on your computer when it happens.
However, we believe a code update on October 1 (specifically,
[commit 17c3f55, or Respond to youtube:request](https://github.com/zSnout/zSnout.com/commit/17c3f55b043c845853d98b57a1dd1286a5168720)),
may have caused a server-side issue that was not resolved until October 3rd at
5:17pm PST. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.
