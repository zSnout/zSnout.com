# The zSnout Language (aka lang)

Disclaimer: this is a _huge_ work in progress. It's zSnout's attempt to create
our own language and we're still thinking of a good name for it.

## The alphabet of lang

lang uses j, k, l, m, n, p, s, t, and w as consonants. In the International
Phonetic Alphabet, /j/ makes the English y sound, so the j in lang makes the
same noise. We use these consonants because they are easily distinguishable and
are used in many popular languages. For vowels, we use i (eee in English), u
(ooo), e (eh), o (oh), and a (ah). lang also has an ei diphthong that makes
English's long I sound (eye).

To write zSnout in lang using the native symbols, we would type sisnaot. The `i`
makes the `ee` sound in zee, and the a and o combined make the `ah o` sound of
`zee sn ah oh t`. lang doesn't have a z sound, so we'll make do with an s. It's
not perfect, but it will do.

In lang's alphabet, the letter order is this: a e i o u j k l m n p s t w.
Notice how the vowels are placed before consonants instead of being sporadically
placed.

## Capitalization

In lang, the only capitalized words are proper nouns. This excludes the
beginning of sentences, titles, and the word god.

## Relationals

After reading about the conlang KÄ“len and how it uses relationals instead of
verbs, I thought it would be a cool idea to add to my own language.
