Recently, I have been learning a language known as toki pona, also known as the
language of good. toki pona's goal is to be a minimalistic language that still
allows its speakers to communicate effectively. toki pona is one of the most
well-known constructed language, or conlangs for short. It is estimated to have
around 300 fluent speakers and over 10,000 people who can effectively read and
understand it. My goal is to become one of those people who are fluent in the
language. Today we'll explore my journey in learning toki pona and how you can
learn it for yourself.`,author:"Zachary Sakowitz",date:16660512e5,category:"language"}},{path:"/blog/lets-make-a-web-framework.md",frontmatter:{excerpt:`
