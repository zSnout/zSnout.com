Most Saurs have a name related to what they do, such as I-like-eating-chicken-saur, but five of them have special names: Bulba, Ivy, Vena, Sam, and Hyacinth. Bulba (he/him) was the second Saur. My family first found him in Mexico on February 21.

Somehow, Bulba, Ivy, Vena, Sam, Hyacinth, and Char all escaped this debacle, but nobody else was okay. There\u2019s a Saur so smart that they use a normal math system (yes, the Saurs have their own math system) called Dumbsaur, and their opposite, Smartsaur, who is the dumbest Saur in the world, except for Dumbest-in-the-world-saur."),e("p",null,"Eventually the Opposition Law was removed at some point due to a Saur going against what their name stood for and it threatened to break down all of everything. Thus, the law was removed. However, to \u201Cminimize confusion,\u201D all existing Saurs continued to have the same names.

This allows the Saurs to upgrade their devices remotely and without needing any hardware changes, as everything is done from their encrypted systems. Of course, SaurAirs have advanced security measures built into them.

In a copy, users can choose to make themselves godlike and have the powers to create, destroy, and modify anything that they see. A common application of this is in photos and videos. Imagine how much better your photos could be if you could add colored lights anywhere you pleased and if you could rotate the scene around any viewpoint you choose. Because SaurAirs have so much storage, Saur photos actually contain a snapshot of the world and have more editing capabilities than anything people can possibly imagine."),e("p",null,"Of course, it might appear awkward to friends if you disappear into an alternate universe for minutes at a time just to take a good photo. That\u2019s why Frames, by default, freeze the external world for up to 5 minutes while you\u2019re in an alternate dimension. To anyone who isn\u2019t in the alternate dimension, the world will still seem normal. The Saurs use these capabilities every day as often as people take standard pictures, but you don\u2019t notice any freezing or strange tears as you walk around on Earth, do you? Of course not.

How would you notice that you had entered an alternate Frame? Well, SaurAirs have the ability to dynamically position any content they want to over what you see, because they have access to your neural system. In fact, this is how you are able to be put into an alternate dimension. SaurAirs simply change the typical connections to your senses and plug in fake data generated by computing the universe.

In one of their global meetings, Ivy proposed that SaurAirs could be used to augment someone\u2019s mind with a digital Frame.

Movies and TV shows could work with all of this new technology without any manual upgrades, thanks to the Saurs\u2019 powerful AI systems.
